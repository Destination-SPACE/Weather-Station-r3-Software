# Examples Index
- [Hello World!](https://github.com/Destination-SPACE/Weather-Station-r3-Software/blob/main/examples/Arduino/dsWeatherStationR3FullTest_1/dsWeatherStationR3FullTest_1.ino): The first example. Used to familiarize with IDE and uploading code
- [Blink](https://github.com/Destination-SPACE/Weather-Station-r3-Software/blob/main/examples/Arduino/blink/blink.ino): Used for learning digital write and controlling the LED on the weather station
- [OLED Test](https://github.com/Destination-SPACE/Weather-Station-r3-Software/blob/main/examples/Arduino/oledTest/oledTest.ino): Testing the OLED display on the weather station by making it say Hello World!
- [Light Sensor](https://github.com/Destination-SPACE/Weather-Station-r3-Software/blob/main/examples/Arduino/lightSensorTest/lightSensorTest.ino): Using a photoresistor to measure ambient light. An example application is measuring how high the sun is in the sky.
- [SD Card Test](https://github.com/Destination-SPACE/Weather-Station-r3-Software/blob/main/examples/Arduino/sdCardTest/sdCardTest.ino): A modified version of the Arduino SD Read/Write script. Used to write data to the onboard microSD card.
- [BME280 Test](https://github.com/Destination-SPACE/Weather-Station-r3-Software/blob/main/examples/Arduino/bme280Test/bme280Test.ino): Testing the BME280 tempreture, pressure, and humidity sensor
- [Full Test](https://github.com/Destination-SPACE/Weather-Station-r3-Software/tree/main/examples/Arduino/FullTest): Combines all the sensors onboard the weather station and prints the data to the OLED display as well as saving it to the microSD card.
